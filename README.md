# QuoteAndWordCount
Count the words with, without and in quotation marks for your essays.

Hi, this is my word count tool for counting words and excluding quotes, could be useful for english essays and the like.

Changelog

v1.1

Fixed a bug where the last word in a quote would be included in the general word count and not the quote count, see v1.0 
for usage instructions

v1.0

Currently only works for text files. 
If you used Word or something else to make your document, right click in a selected area then New > Text Document.
Name the document with a suitable name.
Open the exe and enter the path to the text including the filename. You can get this by opening file explorer and 
copying from the address box at the top. If you do this, then you need to manually add the filename when entering the path.

Example: if i have EnglishEssay.txt on my desktop then I would enter:

C:\Users\MyUser\Desktop\EnglishEssay.txt

Then let the magic happen.
